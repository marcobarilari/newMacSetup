# MacSetup
Collection of info, app and script to automate the setup of my mac pc in a new or renewed machine

## Step 1 - Clean install of the chosen MacOs

### Download and prepare for new installation

see [here](https://bootableinstaller.com/macos/#macos)

## Step 2 - Prepare for the automatic set up with basic tools 

### XCode

It is necessary for eg octave, probably not possible to install it via the terminal (maybe with `mas` but it itself needs it so... but see [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/75684/installing-xcode-via-command-line))

If you need an older version which is not the one on the mac app store (eg Sierra needs 9.2), check [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)

### Homebrew

[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (will install the `Command Line Tools`)

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
